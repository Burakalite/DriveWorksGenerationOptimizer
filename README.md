# DriveWorksGenerationOptimizer

A script to optimize SolidWorks for minimizing generation time when working with DriveWorks autopilot.

Current version 1.00 provides very significant generation speed gains ranging between 1.5x - 4x faster than normal operation.

Further development is pending to increase generation speed further and provide prolonged operation with DriveWorks autopilot.
